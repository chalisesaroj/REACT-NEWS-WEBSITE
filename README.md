# Project Title

A React application that fetches and displays news articles in a dynamic, news-card format.

## Description

This project uses React to render news headlines and articles. Due to the API key limitations of [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/), the application directly uses a local JSON file containing sample news data. This ensures consistent behavior during development and demonstration.

---

### Notes:
- Replace the JSON file with live API integration if you have a valid NewsAPI key.
- Ensure the JSON structure matches the expected format for seamless data rendering.
